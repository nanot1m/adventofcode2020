# What I've learned

## Day 7

- When mapping `map` structure with `map` function it will receive
  pair `[key value]` as an argument to `map`'s callback

- Function `some` returns `true` or `nil`

- Functions `pr` and `prn` prints human readable strings for
  passed arguments. It's useful for debugging

- `drop 1` is the same as `rest`
